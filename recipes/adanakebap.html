    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adana kebabı (colloquially known as Kıyma kebabı) is a long, hand-minced meat kebab mounted on a wide iron skewer and grilled on an open mangal filled with burning charcoal. The culinary item is named after Adana, the fifth largest city of Turkey and was originally known as the "Kıyma kebabı" (lit: minced meat kebab) or Kıyma in Adana-Mersin and the southeastern provinces of Turkey.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons ground sumac, divided</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ice water </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, minced onion and garlic, 1 teaspoon each of the ground cumin and sumac, salt, ground black pepper, red pepper flakes, and ice water.</li>
        <li>Knead the mixture by hand until it turns tacky and starts sticking to the side of the bowl. Place in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes to chill.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands and place a quarter of the lamb mixture onto each skewer. One easy method is to use a 1-ounce scoop to form balls, thread a few onto each skewer, and then mash them together to form the kebab shape.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium-high. In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/2 teaspoon each of ground cumin and sumac.</li>
        <li>Grill the kebabs for approximately 12 minutes, until well charred on both sides. Sprinkle the spice mix over the kebabs while they are cooking.</li>
        <li>If desired, serve the kebabs nestled in lettuce leaves with sliced red onion, parsley, tomatoes, and chopped cucumbers along with warm pita or naan bread. Enjoy.</li>
