    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>İskender kebap is one of the most popular dishes of Turkey. It takes its name from its inventor, İskender Efendi, who lived in Bursa in the late 19th century Ottoman Empire. The dish consists of döner kebab prepared from thinly and carefully cut grilled lamb topped with hot tomato sauce over pieces of pita bread and generously slathered with melted special sheep's milk butter and yogurt. Tomato sauce and melted butter are generally poured over the dish live at the table, for the customer's amusement. "Kebapçı İskender" is trademarked by the İskenderoğlu family, who still run the restaurant in Bursa.[1][2] This dish is available in many restaurants throughout the country mostly under the name "İskender kebap", "Bursa kebabı", or at times with an alternative one made up by the serving restaurant such as "Uludağ kebabı".</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For the meat marinate:</strong></li>
        <li>2 lbs. rib eye steak or lamb or beef tenderloin</li>
        <li>2 large onions, grated</li>
        <li>45 ml / 3 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>10 ml/ 2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>10 ml/ 2 tsp. red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li><strong>For the tomato sauce:</strong></li>
        <li>30 ml / 2 tbsp. concentrated tomato paste</li>
        <li>5 ml/ 1 tbsp. red pepper paste (optional; you can use extra 1 tbsp. tomato paste and red pepper flakes to your taste instead too)</li>
        <li>30 ml/ 2 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>16 fl oz. / 2 cups water</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>2 green pointy or bell peppers, deseeded and sliced</li>
            <li>Thinly sliced pide ekmek or plain pita bread – 6 pieces, to serve</li>
    <li>500 gr / 2 cups plain yoghurt to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 180 C / 350 F</li>
        <li>Prepare the meat marination a day ahead of time of cooking.</li>
        <li>Grate the onions or place them in a food processor and process until liquid. Squeeze all the onion juice into a non-metallic bowl and discard any remaining onion pulp.</li>
        <li>Slice the meat thinly (you can ask your butcher to this for you too) and then pound each slice with the back of a wooden spoon (or with a meat tenderizer). We aim to achieve the slices about 5 cm (2”) x 4 cm (1.5”) in size.</li>
        <li>Combine the onion juice, oregano, red pepper flakes, olive oil, salt and freshly ground pepper in a large bowl. Stir in the meat slices and coat each piece with this marination. Cover the bowl with a cling film and marinate overnight in the fridge.</li>
        <li>To make the tomato sauce, pour in the olive oil in a sauce pan over the medium heat. Stir in the tomato paste, red pepper paste (if using) and red pepper flakes. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and combine well. Add the water then bring to the boil. Then gently simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice the pide or pita bread in 3 cm x 3 cm (about 1”) squares and place on a tray. Warm in the oven for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drizzle a little olive oil on a skillet and cook the meat slices on high heat; for about 2 minutes each side (take care not to overcook). Also sauté the sliced tomatoes and peppers at the other side of the skillet, until they start to charcoal at edges.</li>
        <li>Once everything is cooked, plate your Iskender Kebap. Place the warm pide / pita bread slices on each plate. Spread the cooked slices of the meat over the pide bread and pour over the tomato sauce. Place the sautéed tomatoes and peppers at one side and a dollop of plain yoghurt at the other side. Serve immediately. This recipe serves 4 -6 generously.</li>
